The documentation is written in reStructuredText
(https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html).  It can simply be read as text, or
HTML or a PDF can be generated.  Docutils (https://docutils.sourceforge.io/) is
used to generate the HTML and pandoc (https://pandoc.org/) is used to convert
that HTML to a pdf.

An example Makefile is provided.

Examples:

    make html
    make pdf
